### Timeline

 * Start Date: 1/12/2025

 * Finish Date: 1/21/2025

 * Hours Spent: ~26



### Attributions

* ClaudeAI used to debug `setupTiles()` method during development
* StackOverflow used to learn syntax accasionally


### Running the Program

 * Main class: Run the `main()` method in the Main class to start the game

 * Data files needed: `lvl1.txt`, `lvl2.txt`, and `lvl3.txt` (level maps for the game)

 * Key/Mouse inputs: Use `←` `→` OR `A` `D` to move the paddle. Use `P` to pause the game.

 * Cheat keys:
      * `R` → Reset the ball and paddle
      * `L` → Add a life
      * `M` → Remove a life
      * `B` → Remove a random block
      * `X` → Reverse the X-direction of every ball
      * `E` → Add a ball
      * `W` → Increase the pad width
      * `Q` → Speed up the ball



### Notes/Assumptions

 * Assumptions or Simplifications:
      * N/A

 * Known Bugs: 
      * Very very rarely, the ball will get "stuck" in the wall of the game. I have implemented fixes to prevent this, but it occurs very very rarely.

 * Features implemented:
      * All core features, PAUSE funationality, splash screen between levels, restart game functionality, highscore tracking, positional paddle bouncing, prevention of the paddle leaving the screen, powerup blocks, multi hit blocks, exploding blocks, paddle extension powerup, ball speed powerup, and ball addition powerup

 * Features unimplemented:
      * N/A

 * Noteworthy Features:
      * Highscore is tracked between games and you can pause the game while playing to take a quick break.



### Assignment Impressions
I thought this assignment was really fun. Unfortunately i misundstodd and thought the entire project was due last week on Tuesday, so I did most of the project before realizing my mistake. However, due to this, in incrementally added new features over the last week that weren't required. I found this really fun because I got to learn new things that I didn't previously know. Overall, i found this assignment very fun and would definitely recommend it to others!
