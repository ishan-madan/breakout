# Breakout Plan
### NAME


#### Examples

## Interesting Breakout Variants

 * One variant of breakout that I think is really cool is *Breakthru*. In this variant, instead of bouncing off the tiles, the ball simply passes through the block and kills it. I think this is cool because it can be intrgrated into the standard breakout game as a powerup.

 * Another variant of breakout i find interesting is Pinball breakout. I think this is a really cool way to mix 2 classic games to create interesting new mechanics and fun gameplay.


## Paddle Ideas

 * I really want to make the ball bounce differently based on the part of the paddle that it hits. I feel like this is an important part of the original game and allows for a more skills based gameplay.

 * Another thing that I am thinking of adding is a paddle speed powerup. This powerup would increase the speed of the paddle for a predetermined amount of time to help the user get to the ball faster.


## Block Ideas

 * One block idea I have is taking multiple hits to kill the tile

 * Another one is a powerup block that will be a predetermined powerup

 * A third block idea I have is a respawn block, which, once killed, will respawn at a different predetermined location.


## Power-up Ideas

 * Bigger paddle

 * Adding a ball to the game (until it dies)

 * Speed up the ball

 * Speed up the paddle


## Cheat Key Ideas

 * Reset

 * Add lives

 * Remove Lives

 * Remove random block

 * Reverse the x-direction

 * Add a ball

 * Extend the paddle

 * Speed up the ball

 * Increase paddle speed


## Level Descriptions

 * The first level will be a checkered grid. This will be standard

 * The second level will be a massive 4x10 block of tiles. In this level, the ball will move a little bit faster

 * The third level will be a spiral and the paddle will also be a little bit smaller, which will make it harder to play.


## Class Ideas

 * Ball/Bounce class. This will have a reverseYDirection() method to reverse the Y direction when it hits the pad

 * Pad class. This will have a reset() method which will be used to reset the paddle upon player death.

 * Tile class. This will have a setColor() method, which will set the color of the tile based on its powerup type.

 * Powerup class. This will have a setPowerup() method which will set the said powerup for a set amount of time.
